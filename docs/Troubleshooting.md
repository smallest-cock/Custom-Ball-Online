Just... like... make sure you have good [settings](./Settings.md) my guy

## If menu navigation steps seem wrong

### First:

Manually open the AlphaConsole menu (F5) and make the menu items look like this:

..... open/close any dropdowns or menu trees if you need to.


### If they still seem wrong:

Try cranking up the navigation delay in order to allow a longer time between each step... so you have time to see what's going wrong and what needs to be changed

Then you can edit the menu navigation steps accordingly
