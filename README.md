# Custom Ball Online (BakkesMod plugin)
Enables custom ball textures in online matches

This plugin now works with the latest version of [AlphaConsole](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/108) ðŸ˜„

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This plugin only works with `.png` images (soon to be fixed). If your textures are `.jpg` you should probably convert them to PNG

<br>

## ðŸŽ® How to use

1. Have [AlphaConsole](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/108) installed

2. Have a ball texture selected in AlphaConsole
   
3. Join a match, and your last used ball texture should automatically be applied

<br>

>[!TIP]
>Bind the `cbo_apply_ball_texture` command to manually apply the ball texture whenever you want
>
>(like, in case the texture wasn't applied automatically for some reason)
