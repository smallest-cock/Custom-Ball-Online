Works with the latest version of [AlphaConsole](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/108) 😄

<br>

## 🎮 How to use

1. Have [AlphaConsole](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/108) installed (and this plugin)

2. Have a ball skin selected in AlphaConsole
   
3. Join a match, and your ball skin should automatically be applied

>[!TIP]
>Bind the `cbo_apply_ball_texture` command to apply the ball skin whenever you want
>
>(like if the skin wasn't applied automatically for some reason)
