# Custom-Ball-Online
BakkesMod plugin that automates the process of enabling custom ball textures in online matches

<br>

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Must be using an [older version of AlphaConsole](./AC%20stuff/AlphaConsole.md) for custom ball textures to work in online matches

<br>
Can also be used to automate other things in bakkesmod menus
<br>
<br>

## ðŸŽ® How to use

1. Check the option to run at the start of each match (in plugin settings) ... and/or bind the `enableBallTexture` command
     - With the [Custom Bindings Plugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/228) you can create controller bindings like **triangle + left**

2. Have a ball texture selected in AlphaConsole
   
3. If you unchecked the automatic option, run `enableBallTexture` whenever you want to use a custom ball 
    - If you want to do it as soon as you join a match, wait at least 2-3 seconds to make sure the arena has fully loaded
      
    - You can also run the command while sitting in a tournament waiting screen, and your custom ball texture will be active once the match starts ðŸ˜Š

**Customize the menu navigation behavior in plugin settings**
